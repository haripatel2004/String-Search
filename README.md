This Java program is a simple implementation of a file search task. The program prompts the user to enter a word to search for in a file.
It then reads the file line by line and checks if the current line contains the searched word. If it does, the line is printed to the console.

Here is a summary of the code:

→ A File object is created to represent the input file.

→ A FileReader object is created to read from the file.

→ A Scanner object is created to read input from the user.

→ The user is prompted to enter a word to search for.

→ A BufferedReader object is created to read from the file using the FileReader.

→ The program enters a loop that reads from the file one line at a time.

→ If the current line contains the searched word, it is printed to the console.

→ The FileReader is closed when the program is done reading from the file.
